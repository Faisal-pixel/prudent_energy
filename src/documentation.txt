# Bug: Figuring out how to add the toggle button in the Create New Bidder form under the service categories, and also updating it in the state.
# Solution: So I installed all fontawesome dependies and imported them. I also increased using tailwind "text". To update the state I gave the icon a data-icon-name attribute and set it to the name it represent in the state. For instance "data-icon-name="insurance". Since their initial value is a boolean and it is set to false, I used that to check for whether the toggle is on or off using ternary operation. The fontawesome icon has two state, faToggleOn and faToggleOff. Then I created a helper function handleToggleOnClick(e, "serviceCategories") which receives the event and then the category in the form. Did this because of the way my state is structured.
  Here is the structure of my state:
    const [createNewBidderFormValues, setCreateNewBidderFormValues] = useState({
        general: {
            bidderNumber: "",
            name: "",
            lastDateModified: "",
            status: ""
        },
        addressAndContact: {
            address1: "",
            address2: "",
            city: "",
            contactPersonName: "",
            phoneNumber: "",
            email: "",
        },
        payment: {
            tinNumber: "",
            paymentTermCode: "",
        },
        serviceCategories: {
            serviceClass: "",
            insurance: false,
            freight: false,
            agency: false,
            storage: false
        }

    });
    Here is the helper function and how it updates the state:
        const handleToggleOnClick = (e, section) => {
        const name = e.currentTarget.getAttribute("data-icon-name");
        setCreateNewBidderFormValues((prevState) => (
            {...prevState, [section]: {...prevState[section], [name]: !prevState.serviceCategories[name]}}
        ))
    }
    So basically, it gets the name of the toggle from the data-icon-name value by using e.currentTarget.getAttribute, and then using setCreateNewBidderFormValues;
    it makes use of the prevState useState hook provides us and then returns an object, spreading the prevState, then using the selection we pass in earlier,
    I use it to select which category I want to update, which is the serviceCategories, and then spread back in the prevState of this category while using the name i got to select which
    key in the serviceCategories I want to update and then set it to always be the opposite vale of the previous state
